# Membership Management System (ShopID)

## Introduction
Over the past several years, SYN Shop has grown to a size where validating membership is no longer via a first-name basis. The shop was in need of something more robust, automated and easy to use.

Some of the features included are:

- Membership Status Tracking
- Contact Information / Emergency Contact Tracking
- Real-time Payment Processor Information (via Stripe) to show payment / subscription status
- Shop Liability Waiver (scanned document) Management

## Accessing ShopID
Currently only available on the Shop network or over VPN, log in to ShopId by visiting [https://shopid.synshop.net](https://shopid.synshop.net) and authenticate using your Auth0 username / password.  Please note that you'll need to be in the correct Auth0 admin group to have full access to the system.  Please reach out to a board member to be added to the group.
